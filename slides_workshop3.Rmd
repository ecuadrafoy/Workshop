# R and Bioinformatics
- Bioinformatics - like biology - **it's messy**. Dealing with different organisms, different systems, conditions.

- Bioinformatics experiments involve testing and **tweaking parameters** and most tools available involve some sort of coding
  - Commercial tools are expensive and licensed.
  
- R shines with a variety of **statistical tools** available and in generation of **publication-quality** graphs and figures
  - RNA-Seq, population genomics, etc

- Before using any of these tools, make sure to be **working on a tidy and organized dataset**. The tool will not prepare the data for you.

---
# Plotting with `ggplot`
- While `ggplot` is not a tool specific to bioinformatics, it will help you produce quality plots for any kind of dataset you are working with <img src = "https://www.ericchowkokyew.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png" width=40% border=1 align="right" ><BR CLEAR="left">

- In `ggplot` graphs are made of **layers** that are placed on top of each other 

- Each layer contains **visual objects**. Visual elements are referred to as *geoms* (geometric objects)

- *Geoms* are added to the plot using the **+** sign

- The aesthetic properties help determine the color, shape, and size of the elements for each layer. Referred as *Aes*

---
# Plotting with `ggplot`
- A Histogram with the `mtcars` dataset
- The `stat` function inside the histogram creates data not from the data itself, however it was mapped to `count`
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
data(mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=stat(count)))
```
---
# Plotting with `ggplot`
- We can adjust the `stat` function to tell `ggplot` that we want to use calculated aesthetics produced by the statistic
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
data(mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=stat(count/max(count))))
```
---
# Adding p-values and significance in `ggplot`
- A required package to install is `ggpubr` which provides ggplot2-based publication ready plots
  - Install it as such `install.packages('ggpubr')`
  - Then load it with `library(ggpubr)`
- For this example we will work with the **ToothGrowth** dataset. 
  - Data set contains the result from an experiment studying the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth (**len**) in 60 Guinea pigs
  - Each animal received doses (**supp**) of vitamin C by one of two delivery methods, juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (VC)
  - Each animal received one of three doses (**dose**) of vitamin C: 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
data("ToothGrowth")
head(ToothGrowth)
```
---
# Adding p-values and significance in `ggplot`
- `ggpubr` adds two new functions, 
  - `Compare_means()`, easy to use solution to perform one and multiple mean comparisons
  - `stat_compare_means()`, solution to automatically add p-values and significance levels to `ggplot`

- `compare_means(formula, data, method = "wilcox.test", paired = FALSE, group.by = NULL, ref.group = NULL, ...)`
  - In `formula` you have **x**, as a numeric variable and then compare it to a group using **~**
  - In this case the `method` is set by default to be a Wilcoxon test. Allowed variables include `t.test`, `anova`, `kruskal.test`
  - `Paired` indicates that you want a paired test, only used for `t.test` and `wilcox.test`
  
---
# Adding p-values and significance in `ggplot`
- Let's perform a test on our dataset
- **len** contains the length of the Guinea pig teeth and **supp* is the type of delivery method
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
compare_means(len~supp, data = ToothGrowth)
```
  
---
# Adding p-values and significance in `ggplot`
- `stat_compare_means()` acts as a geometrical layer on `ggplot` that performs the same tests but can be used with box plots, dot plots, bar plots and line plots
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
p <- ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x = 'supp', y= 'len',
               color = 'supp', add = 'jitter')
p
```
---
# Adding p-values and significance in `ggplot`
- Added the p-value on the graph directly
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
p + stat_compare_means(method = "t.test")
```
---
# Adding p-values and significance in `ggplot`
- The `stat_compare_means()` function can be modified further to display the desired aesthetics
- We can see that there is no difference between OJ and VC with regards to tooth length
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=5,fig.height=4}
p + stat_compare_means(method = "t.test", aes(label = ..p.signif..),
                       label.x = 1.5, label.y = 40)
```
---
# Adding layers
- We can apply a `facet_grid()` layer which allows us to further stratify our data
- In this case we want to build facets for each dose group, and comparing OJ vs VC
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.height=4}
p + stat_compare_means(method = "t.test", aes(label = ..p.signif..),
                       label.x = 1.5, label.y = 35)+
                      facet_grid(~dose)
```

# Exploring cytokine data from fibroblasts
- Data from "Distinct fibroblast subsets drive inflammation and damage in arthritis", Croft et.al (2019)
- The data is in a format that is easy for us to interpret, but `ggplot` prefers long formats
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.height=4}
data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecuadrafoy/Workshop/master/figure_4a.csv')
head(data)
```
---
# Exploring cytokine data from fibroblasts
- We need to convert from a wide format to a long format, using the function `pivot_long()`
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.height=4}
data_long <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Cytokine,
               names_to = c("thy", "status", "repeat"),
               names_sep = "_",
               values_to = "levels") %>% 
  select(-'repeat') %>% 
  unite('status', c('thy','status'))
kable(head(data_long, "simple"))
```
---
# `ggplot` is a highly versatile tool
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", warning=FALSE}
my_comparisons <- list( c("Thy1_minus", "Thy1_plus")) #The two groups to compare
 cytokines <- data_long %>% ggplot(aes(x=status, y=levels, fill=status))+ #Pick the axes
   
      stat_summary(fun='mean', geom='bar')+ # Pick the stat to measure, in this case mean
   
      scale_fill_manual(values=c("grey","black"))+ # Pick the colours for your barplot
   
      facet_wrap(~Cytokine, scales = "free_y")+ # Determine the variable by which to create facets
   
      stat_compare_means(comparisons = my_comparisons,
                      method = "t.test", aes(label = ..p.signif..), 
                      size=2, paired = TRUE)+ # Apply the t-test
   
      labs(x='Thy status',
            y = 'Cytokine levels',
            title = 'Figure 4a',
            subtitle = "Croft et al, Nature, 2019")+ #Name the labels
   
      theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = FALSE))+ # Options to make the configure the graph look
      theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))
```

# Getting started with `BioconductoR`
- Bioconductor provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.
- Bioconductor software packages focused on the analysis of single channel Affymetrix and two or more channel cDNA/Oligo microarrays
- As the project has matured, the functional scope of the software packages broadened to include the analysis of all types of genomic data, such as SAGE, sequence, or SNP data.
- As of April 28 2020, there are 1903 packages available
- Bioconductor is a huge module, and has its own installation manager. Be sure to initialize the following line before installing any packages
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment="", eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
```

# Processing RNASeq Data with `tidybulk`
- The tidybulk package provides a tidy data structure and a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses
<img src = "https://stemangiola.github.io/tidybulk/inst/logo.png" width=40% align="right" ><BR CLEAR="left">

- `tidybulk` allows differential expression analysis from RNA sequencing datasets in a friendly way.

- The minimal input dataframe for `tidybulk` to work requires the following:
  - Sample column(`chr` or `fctr`) 
  - Transcript/gene column (`chr` or `fctr`)
  - Abundance/counts column (`integer`)
- Creates a tidy transcriptomics object (**tt**) from a tibble (**tbl**) which is a `tidyverse` dataframe
-To install `tidybulk` and any other BioconductoR package, we use the following syntax:
  - `BiocManager::install("tidybulk")`
