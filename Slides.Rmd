- Widely used among statisticians, data scientists and is currently ranked 9th in the TIOBE index

- R includes a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques
- Many free resources to learn `R`
- **It's free!**
---
# Setting up R
- R can be accessed through two methods

- Downloading and installing RStudio Desktop and R from the following link 
  + https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download

- Using the cloud version of RStudio. No install required, can be run from the browser
  + https://rstudio.cloud/

# Working to RStudio

- Getting to know the environment

---
# Working with RStudio
- Before starting any kind of work it is **very important** to have your environment set
- An environment is the space where all your variables, formulas, plots and everything related to your project will be saved

---
# What statistical functions are in R?
- Writing the following function will show you the list of statistical tests available
```{r, echo = TRUE, tidy=TRUE, comment=""}

library(help = "stats")
```

# Specialized tools for Bioinformatics
Bioconductor is a project that focuses in providing `R` tools for analysis of high-throughput biological assays. Some of the project's goals include:
.pull-left[
- Provide widespread access to a borad range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for analysis of genomic data
- Facilitate he inclusion of biological metadata in the analysis of genomic data from different sources
- Provide a common software platform that enables rapid development of interoperable software
- Train researchers on computational and statistical methods

# Basic R Operations
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment=""}
1+1  #Simple Arithmetic
2 + 3 * 4 #PEMDAS also applies 
3 ^ 2 #Exponentiation 
exp(1) #Basic mathematical functions are available

```
---
# Basic R Operations
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment=""}
sqrt(10)

pi #constants are also defined within R

2+pi*43 #Some random operation
```

# Variables in R
- Variables are names for values. Created variables can be found in the workspace pane.
- Numeric
  + Store floating point values
- Boolean (True or False)
  + TRUE or FALSE are reserved values, can not be used to name variables
- Strings
  + Essentially text, sequences of characters
- A variable can be determined with the `<-` operator
---
# Variables in R
- Shortcut for the `<-` operator, `Alt + -`
- `x <- 1` Assigns 1 to a variable called `x`
- `y <- 3` Assigns 3 to a variable called `y`
- `z <- 4` Assigns 4 to a variable called `z`
- `x*y*x` We can perform operations with variables, if allowed

```{r, comment=""}
x <- 1
y <- 3
z <- 4
x * y * z
```

---
# Variables in R
- Variables under the same name can overwrite each other when called later

```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
x <- 1
x <- 3

x == 1 #Is x still 1?
x == 3 #Is x now 3?
```
---
# Variables in R
- Certain rules must be respected when naming variables
- `letters_123. <- 4` Letters, numbers, dots, and underscores are allowed
  + `letters.123_awesome`
  + Can start with a dot but it should not be followed by a number `.letters123` 
- Variables can't start with numbers `1illegalvariable` 
- The `%` character isn't allowed `another%badvariable` 
- Starting with `_` isn't valid `_lastbadvariable` 
- Variables can hold Numeric, Boolean and String values the same way
  + `x <- 23`
  + `y <- "I love this variable"`

---
# Vectors
- In `R` a vector is a collection of numbers, individual numbers are elements of the vector
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
myvector <- c(10,20,30,40,50)

myvector + 1

myvector + myvector

length(myvector)

c(myvector, myvector)
```

---
# Vectors
- We can create and index vectors with `:`
- Indexing means accessing specific elements in the vector
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
autovector <- 1:10
autovector
autovector[1]
items <- c("spam", "eggs", "beans", "bacon", "sausage")
items[1:4]

```
---
# Vectors
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
plot(autovector, autovector*autovector)
```
---
# Functions
- Functions are things that `R` do for us: calculate, manipulate data, read and write to files, produce plots.
- `R` contains many functions and we can also build our own (more advanced stuff)
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
myvector
sum(myvector)
rep(42,10) #Repeats the number 42, 10 times
rep(c(1,2,3),10) #Functions work from the inner brackets to the outer ones. In this case it creates a vector first, and then proceeds to repeat it  10 times
```
---
#Working with Data
## Data frames and the Tidyverse
- Data frames is the `R` name for tabular data. Essentially tables.
- Generally we want each row in a data frame to represent a unit of observation and each column to contain a different type of information
- As a beginner, it is advisable to prepare your tabular data in Excel prior to working in `RStudio`
- We will work with data using a package called `Tidyverse` which contains many popular tools used for data analysis in `R`
- To install `Tidyverse` in your computer write `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- To load `Tidyverse` write `library(tidyverse)`
- Whenever you close `RStudio` make sure to run the `library(tidyverse)` function the first time you log back in
---
#Working with Data
## Opening a csv file
- Save the file you wish to work with in the directory where you saved your project
- This will ensure you don't have you search everywhere in your computer and makes it easy for `RStudio` to access them
<img align="center" src="directory.png" width="600" height="400"/>
---
#Working with Data
## Opening a csv file
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
geo <- readr::read_csv("geo.csv")
geo
```
---
#Working with Data
## Exploring the data
- We can extract details from the dataset
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
nrow(geo) #Number of observations
ncol(geo) #Number of columns
colnames (geo) #Names of the columns
```
---
#Working with Data
## Exploring the data
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
summary(geo) #Descriptive statistics (if available) for each column
```
---
#Working with Data
## Indexing data frames
- The syntax to subset (selecting parts of a table) data frames is `[row,column]`
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
geo[4,2] #Here were are taking row 4, column 2.
geo[4,"region"] #We can also use the name of the column instead. Be aware that this is case-sensitive
```
---
#Working with Data
## Indexing data frames
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
geo[4,] #We can choose a row and all the columns that are associated with it by leaving an empty space
head(geo[,"region"]) #Similarly we can choose an entire column alone with all its rows
```
---
#Working with Data
## Indexing data frames
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
geo[c(1,50,180),] #We can index different rows in one line
head(geo[2:8,]) #Selecting a sequence of rows is called slicing
```
---
#Working with Data
## Logical indexing
- Instead of specifying rows and columns we can use logic to determine `TRUE` values that fit our request
- The `tidyverse` package provides the function `filter()` which allows this to happen in a much easier way than using pure `R`
- Some operators available include
  + `x==y` Equal to
  + `x!=y` Not equal to
  + `x<y` Less than
  + `x>y` Greater than
  + `x<=y` Less than or equal to
  + `x>=y` Greater than or equal to
  
---
#Working with Data
## Logical indexing
- We want countries that are positioned on latitudes that are negative, meaning southern
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE}
dplyr::filter(geo, lat< 0) #Select the dataframe first, then the condition, negative lat values
```
---
#Simple Graph Creation

- `Tidyverse` contains the package `ggplot2` which can assist in creating custom made plots
- Three things to consider
  + A dataframe
  + How the columns of the dataframe can be translated into positions, colors, size, and shapes of graphical elements. The "aesthetics"
  + The actual graphical element to display (scatterplot, lineplot, barplots)
```{r, message=FALSE}
geo <- readr::read_csv("geo.csv")
gap <- readr::read_csv("gap-minder.csv")
gap_geo <- dplyr::left_join(gap, geo, by="name")
head(gap_geo)
```
---
# Simple Graphs
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot2::ggplot(gap_geo, ggplot2::aes(x=year, y=life_exp)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point()
```
---
# Simple Graphs
Let's trying adding more `Aesthetics(R)`
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot2::ggplot(gap_geo, ggplot2::aes(x=year, y=life_exp, color = region, size = population)) +
    ggplot2::geom_point()
```
---
# Simple Graphs
-Boxplots look cool in publications (not these ones though)
-The year aesthetic separates the boxplots by year, otherwise it would be one single boxplot
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot2::ggplot(gap_geo, ggplot2::aes(x=year, y=life_exp, color = region, group=year)) +
    ggplot2::geom_boxplot()
```
