# Outline 

- Introduction
- Transforming data with `dplyr`
- Wrangling data with `tidyr`
- Creating our own functions
- Iterating with for loops
---
# The importance of tidying your data
- Making sure your data is ready before analysis could save you a lot of headaches

&gt; Data scientists according to interviews and expert estimates spend from 50% to 80% of their time mired in the mundane labour of collecting and preparing data, before it can be explored for useful information - New York Times (2014)

- Life science data isn't much of an issue
  - Most of it is already in tables
  - Not as diverse
  - Working with images could be tricky
- The need for tools that can deal with tons of data has led to the creation of packages that are simple to use and understand for humans
- The process of removing or adding columns, edit and clean the data is called **data wrangling**

---
# What is Tidy Data?
- The concept of tidy data is very simple, put variables in columns and observations in rows

&lt;img src="tidy_data.png" width="60%" border="1"/&gt;

- Making data tidy is critical, instead of building analyses around whatever weird format the data is in
- Once the data is tidy, we can use a growing assortment of powerful analytical and visualization tools

# What is Tidy Data?
## The Tidyverse ecosystem

---
# Setup

- Start a new session, or open the previous one
- Open a new R script file
- Load the `tidyverse` package

```r
## install.packages("tidyverse")
## library(tidyverse)
```
- We will work with the Gapminder data. You can download the file from the github repository. Make sure to add it to your current session
- Or you can take the url directly from github and write it to the `read_csv()` function. Remember to add quotation marks

# Exploring the Gapminder dataframe

```r
gapminder &lt;- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
head(gapminder)  # shows the top 6 using head(gapminder,10) would show the top 10 instead

# *dplyr()* Basics
- We saw some functions in the previous workshop, but here we will list the most important 
- `filter()`: picks observations by their values. Subset by **rows**
- `select()`: pick variables by their names. Subset by **columns**
- `mutate()`: create new variables with functions of existing variables. **Create** new columns
- `summarise()`: collapse many values down to a single summary. 
- `arrange()` : reorder rows, ascending or descending
- All these functions work similarly
  - first argument is the dataframe: `filter(dataframe,...)`
  - Subsequent arguments describe what to do. Call specific columns, use logical expressions, etc.
  - The final result is a new dataframe
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `filter()` function
- We saw filter being used previously. This function will select *rows* by evaluating a certain logical expression
- Visually this is what `filter()` is doing

![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-filter.png)
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `filter()` function
- Here we apply two conditions: only countries that have Peru and Mexico in their rows and when life expectancy was less than 60 years old

```r
filter(gapminder, country %in% c("Mexico", "Peru"), lifeExp &lt; 60)
```

```
# A tibble: 9 x 6
  country  year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Mexico   1952 30144317 Americas     50.8     3478.
2 Mexico   1957 35015548 Americas     55.2     4132.
3 Mexico   1962 41121485 Americas     58.3     4582.
4 Peru     1952  8025700 Americas     43.9     3759.
5 Peru     1957  9146100 Americas     46.3     4245.
6 Peru     1962 10516500 Americas     49.1     4957.

9 Peru     1977 15990099 Americas     58.4     6281.
```
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `select()` function
- `select()` is used to subset the data on variables or columns. 
- Visually this is what `select()` is doing
![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-select.png)
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `select()` function

```r
select(gapminder, year, country, lifeExp)
```

```
# A tibble: 1,704 x 3
    year country     lifeExp
   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;
 1  1952 Afghanistan    28.8
 2  1957 Afghanistan    30.3
 3  1962 Afghanistan    32.0
 4  1967 Afghanistan    34.0
 5  1972 Afghanistan    36.1
 6  1977 Afghanistan    38.4
 7  1982 Afghanistan    39.9
 8  1987 Afghanistan    40.8
 9  1992 Afghanistan    41.7
10  1997 Afghanistan    41.8
# ... with 1,694 more rows
```
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## Combining `select()` and `filter()`
- We can combine both functions to produce custom tables that reflect our needs
- For this example, only **filter** rows that contain `Cambodia` and **select** the columns `Year`, `Country`, and `lifeExp`

```r
gap_cambodia  &lt;- filter(gapminder, country == "Cambodia") 
gap_cambodia  &lt;- select(gap_cambodia, year, country, lifeExp) 
head(gap_cambodia)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 3
   year country  lifeExp
  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
1  1952 Cambodia    39.4
2  1957 Cambodia    41.4
3  1962 Cambodia    43.4
4  1967 Cambodia    45.4
5  1972 Cambodia    40.3
6  1977 Cambodia    31.2
```
- As we add more functions, it becomes cumbersome to keep track of all of them.
- We can solve this by using the pipe operator `%&gt;%` 
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## Using `%&gt;%` 
- Shortcuts for the pipe operator are `Ctrl + Shift + M` for Windows and `Cmd + Shift + M` for Mac
-`%&gt;%` makes life easier by stringing several function operations in a single one
- To use the pipe operator, you call the dataframe first.
- Our previous example using `%&gt;%` means the same as saying:
  - Take the `gapminder` data, filter only the Countries that are equal to Cambodia, select columns `year`, `country`, and `lifeExp`. Finally save the results in the variable `gap_cambodia`

```r
gap_cambodia  &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %&gt;%
  select(year, country, lifeExp)
```
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `mutate()` function 
- If we need to add a column using data from other columns, we can use the `mutate()` function.
![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-mutate.png)
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `mutate()` function 
- Calculate each country's annual GDP which is the multiplication of population by GDP per capita
- We create a new column called `gdp` and perform the operation

```r
gapminder %&gt;% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %&gt;% head()
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 7
  country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap          gdp
  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Afghanistan  1952  8425333 Asia         28.8      779.  6567086330.
2 Afghanistan  1957  9240934 Asia         30.3      821.  7585448670.
3 Afghanistan  1962 10267083 Asia         32.0      853.  8758855797.
4 Afghanistan  1967 11537966 Asia         34.0      836.  9648014150.
5 Afghanistan  1972 13079460 Asia         36.1      740.  9678553274.
6 Afghanistan  1977 14880372 Asia         38.4      786. 11697659231.
```
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `group_by()` function 
- The `group_by()` function takes an existing table and converts it into a grouped table where operations are performed "by group". Use `ungroup()` to remove grouping. 
- The function creates a *grouping variable*. Doesn't do anything on its own.
![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-group_by.png)
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## The `group_by()` function 
- We set the grouping variable to `continent` then create a new column called `cont_pop` that will add upp all country populations by their associated continents
- At the end we have the sum of the total population for each continent from which that country is part of in 2002

```r
gapminder %&gt;%
  filter(year == 2002) %&gt;% # Only data from the year 2002
  group_by(continent) %&gt;% # Group the data by continent
  mutate(cont_pop = sum(pop)) %&gt;% head() # Perform a sum on the population column by continent
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 7
# Groups:   continent [5]
  country      year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap   cont_pop
  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Afghanistan  2002 25268405 Asia         42.1      727. 3601802203
2 Albania      2002  3508512 Europe       75.7     4604.  578223869
3 Algeria      2002 31287142 Africa       71.0     5288.  833723916
4 Angola       2002 10866106 Africa       41.0     2773.  833723916
5 Argentina    2002 38331121 Americas     74.3     8798.  849772762

```
---
# *dplyr()* Basics
## Distilling information with `summarize()`
- If we don't want any repetitive data, we can use the `summarize()` function
- `summarize()` will create a new dataframe. It will have one, or more rows for each combination of grouping variables. It will contain one column for each grouping variable and one column for each of the summary statistics specified
- Some useful summary statistics that can be used in `summarize()` include `mean()`,`median()`,`sd()`,`IQR()`,`min()`,`max()`,`n()`. 
![](http://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-summarise.png)
---
# *dplyr()* 
## Distilling information with `summarize()`
- The following will filter the population in each continent in 2002 by adding the individual countries that fall into that group. 


```r
gapminder %&gt;%
  filter(year == 2002) %&gt;%
  group_by(continent) %&gt;%
  #mutate(cont_pop=sum(pop)) #If we left mutate() it would output all the rows
  summarize(cont_pop = sum(pop)) #With summarize we get only the values for each continent
```

```
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent   cont_pop
  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Africa     833723916
2 Americas   849772762
3 Asia      3601802203
4 Europe     578223869
5 Oceania     23454829
```
---
# *dplyr()* 
## `summarize()` and then `arrange()` its order
- We can group by and do summary for more than one column
- We then want to see the table in ascending order for `year`. Currently it is ordered alphabetically

```r
gapminder %&gt;%
  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;%
  summarize(cont_pop = sum(pop))%&gt;%
  arrange(year) %&gt;%
  head() 
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 3
# Groups:   continent [5]
  continent  year    cont_pop
  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Africa     1952  237640501 
2 Americas   1952  345152446 
3 Asia       1952 1395357352.
4 Europe     1952  418120846 
5 Oceania    1952   10686006 
6 Africa     1957  264837738 
```
---
# *dplyr()* 
## Example
- What is the maximum GDP per continent across all years?

```r
gapminder %&gt;%
  group_by(continent, year) %&gt;% #Select grouping variables
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %&gt;% #Create a new column
  #Show only the columns based on grouping variables
  summarize(max_gdp = max(gdp)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(year) %&gt;% #arrange by the year
  head()
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 3
# Groups:   continent [5]
  continent  year max_gdp
  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Africa     1952 6.74e10
2 Americas   1952 2.20e12
3 Asia       1952 2.78e11
4 Europe     1952 5.03e11
5 Oceania    1952 8.73e10
6 Africa     1957 8.86e10

# Reshaping data with *tidyr()* 
- Now we have some experience with data that is in a tidy way.
- However most real data doesn't start off like that and requires some reshaping to become tidy
- `tidyr` is for reshaping data. It is less commonly use than `dplyr` but is still good to know how to use both
.center[![](http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/images/tidyr.png)]

---
# Reshaping data with *tidyr()* 
What's the advantage of "tidying" up the data?
1. Having a consistent data structure, makes it easy to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity
  - Data is often stored in a way that makes entry easy
2. Most built-in R functions work with vectors of values.
  - Remember the principles of tidy data: each variable is its own column, each observation its own row, and each value must have its own cell
.center[![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)]

# Spreading and Gathering
- A common problem is a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables bu values of a variable.
  - Ex: Columns for several timepoints of one observation.
  - Years spread into different columns
- A dataset like this needs to gather those columns into a new pair of variables

```r
gapminder_wide &lt;- read_csv("gapminder_wide.csv")
colnames(gapminder_wide)
```

```
 [1] "continent"      "country"        "gdpPercap_1952" "gdpPercap_1957"
 [5] "gdpPercap_1962" "gdpPercap_1967" "gdpPercap_1972" "gdpPercap_1977"
 [9] "gdpPercap_1982" "gdpPercap_1987" "gdpPercap_1992" "gdpPercap_1997"
[13] "gdpPercap_2002" "gdpPercap_2007" "lifeExp_1952"   "lifeExp_1957"  
[17] "lifeExp_1962"   "lifeExp_1967"   "lifeExp_1972"   "lifeExp_1977"  
[21] "lifeExp_1982"   "lifeExp_1987"   "lifeExp_1992"   "lifeExp_1997"  
[25] "lifeExp_2002"   "lifeExp_2007"   "pop_1952"       "pop_1957"      
[29] "pop_1962"       "pop_1967"       "pop_1972"       "pop_1977"      
[33] "pop_1982"       "pop_1987"       "pop_1992"       "pop_1997"      
[37] "pop_2002"       "pop_2007"      
```

# Spreading and Gathering
- The function `gathering()` allows us to convert data from a **wide** format into a **long** format or vice versa.
  - A long format is preferred when using `ggplot` visualizations
- In our example, we wish to keep `country` and `continent` columns and create a new column that takes the spread variable into one. This is called a *key*. 
- We want to create three columns that hold `gdpPercap`, `lifeExp` and `pop` as variables and 
---

# Spreading and Gathering

```r
gap_long &lt;- gapminder_wide %&gt;% 
  gather(key = 'year', value = 'observations')
head(gap_long)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 2
  year      observations
  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       
1 continent Africa      
2 continent Africa      
3 continent Africa      
4 continent Africa      
5 continent Africa      
6 continent Africa      
```

```r
tail(gap_long, n=4)
```

```
# A tibble: 4 x 2
  year     observations
  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;       
1 pop_2007 71158647    
2 pop_2007 60776238    
3 pop_2007 20434176    
4 pop_2007 4115771     
```
---
# Spreading and Gathering
- Selecting all the columns one by one would take a lot of work, instead we can use the `starts_with()` function from `dplyr` that looks for variables that start with the desired character string. 

```r
gap_long &lt;- gapminder_wide %&gt;% 
  gather(key = year, value = observations, 
         starts_with('pop'),
         starts_with('lifeExp'),
         starts_with('gdpPercap')) #listing all the columns to use in gather
head(gap_long)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 4
  continent country      year     observations
  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;
1 Africa    Algeria      pop_1952      9279525
2 Africa    Angola       pop_1952      4232095
3 Africa    Benin        pop_1952      1738315
4 Africa    Botswana     pop_1952       442308
5 Africa    Burkina Faso pop_1952      4469979
6 Africa    Burundi      pop_1952      2445618
```
---
# Spreading and Gathering
- Alternatively we can accomplish almost the same by ignoring the `country` and `continent` columns from being included in the `gather()` function. 

```r
gap_long &lt;- gapminder_wide %&gt;% 
  gather(key   = year,
         value = observations,
         -continent, -country)
head(gap_long)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 4

# Spreading and Gathering
- Everything is looking good, however there is a little problem. The column `year` doesn't contain only the year but also the observation type. We can use `separate()` to split the character strings into variables.

```r
gap_long &lt;- gap_long %&gt;%
  separate(year, #pick the column we want to separate
           into = c('obs_type', 'year'), #Creates two columns
           sep = "_", # assigns the character separator
           convert = TRUE)#this ensures that the year column is an integer rather than a character
head(gap_long)
```

```

# Spreading and Gathering
- `spread()` is essentially the opposite of `gather()`. It transforms data from long to wide format. 

```r
gap_wide_again &lt;- gap_long %&gt;% 
  unite(col = var_names, obs_type, year, sep = "_") %&gt;% 
  #Unite(), the opposite of separate.
  #unite obs_type and year into a new column called var_names. Separate by _
  spread(key = var_names, value = observations)# Spread var_names out by key_value pair
colnames(gap_wide_again)
```

# An Introduction to Functions
- One of the best ways to improve our code is to write functions. 
- Functions allow you to automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting.
- You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code)
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.learnbyexample.org/wp-content/uploads/r/r-function-syntax.png" width="50%" border="1"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Key Steps:
1. Pick a *name* for the function
2. List the inputs or *arguments*, to the functions
3. Place the code you have developed in *body* of the function
---
# An Introduction to Functions

```r
sum &lt;- function(x,y){
  return(x + y)
}
sum(4,3)
```

```
[1] 7
```

```r
sum(1,3)
```

```
[1] 4
```

```r
sum(5,6)
```

```
[1] 11
```
---
# An Introduction to Functions
- We can return multiple values by saving the results in a vector or list and then return it
- The function will return the last statement by default

```r
math_fn &lt;- function(x,y){
  add &lt;- x + y
  sub &lt;- x - y
  mul &lt;- x * y
  div &lt;- x / y
  c(addition = add, subtraction = sub,
    multiplication = mul, divisions = div)
}

math_fn(20, 6)
```

```
      addition    subtraction multiplication      divisions 
     26.000000      14.000000     120.000000       3.333333

# Using functions in datasets
- Let's look at the `mtcars` dataset that is included in R
- The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles

```r
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
```

```
'data.frame':	32 obs. of  11 variables:
 $ mpg : num  21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ...
 $ cyl : num  6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ...
 $ disp: num  160 160 108 258 360 ...
 $ hp  : num  110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ...
 $ drat: num  3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ...
 $ wt  : num  2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ...
 $ qsec: num  16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ...
 $ vs  : num  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...
 $ am  : num  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
 $ gear: num  4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ...
 $ carb: num  4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ...

# Using functions in datasets
- Group the cars by cylinder and calculate the mean for miles per gallon for all the cars with their respective cylinder. 

```r
mtcars %&gt;%
  group_by(cyl) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean_mpg =mean(mpg))
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 2
    cyl mean_mpg
  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
1     4     26.7
2     6     19.7
3     8     15.1
```
---
# Using functions in datasets
- We can build a function that can perform these two steps in one, not just for this dataset but for any other we would like to execute a `group_by` followed by a `summarize`
- The function takes arguments that will then be passed on to the body of the function. However because we want to keep it dynamic, we need to tweak a few things using `enquo()` from the `rlang` package. Arguments act as placeholders

```r
#make sure to load the rlang library to use enquo library(rlang)
simple_fn &lt;- function(data., col_name){
  # Arguments: data. = Dataframe
  #           col_name = a placeholder variable
  #                       replaced with a variable of your choosing
  # Enquo makes sure that it understands that col_name is a placeholder
  col_name &lt;- enquo(col_name) 
data. %&gt;%
  group_by(!!col_name) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean = mean(mpg))
}
```
---

```r
mtcars %&gt;% simple_fn(cyl)
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 2
    cyl  mean
  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
1     4  26.7
2     6  19.7
3     8  15.1
```
---
# Making it more dynamic
- So far our function will take a dataset and a column of your choosing to provide you with grouped summary statistics
- We can expand this and add more than just the mean of `mpg` 

```r
dynamic_fn &lt;- function(data., group_col, ...){
  col_name &lt;- enquo(group_col)
  col_vars &lt;- quos(...)
data. %&gt;%
  group_by(!!col_name) %&gt;%
  summarise_at(vars(!!!col_vars), list(mean = mean,sd = sd, min = min, max = max))
}
mtcars %&gt;% dynamic_fn(cyl, hp, wt, mpg) #Arguments are: column you wish to group by and then the columns you wish to do the summary statistics on
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 13
    cyl hp_mean wt_mean mpg_mean hp_sd wt_sd mpg_sd hp_min wt_min mpg_min hp_max
  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
1     4    82.6    2.29     26.7  20.9 0.570   4.51     52   1.51    21.4    113
2     6   122.     3.12     19.7  24.3 0.356   1.45    105   2.62    17.8    175
3     8   209.     4.00     15.1  51.0 0.759   2.56    150   3.17    10.4    335
# ... with 2 more variables: wt_max &lt;dbl&gt;, mpg_max &lt;dbl&gt;
```

---
# Using for loops 
- Functions are great help for reducing duplication. Combine functions with *iteration* and then it helps us saving time on repeating the same thing on multiple inputs.
- The `for` statement will iterate (perform an operation) over the items of a vector or a list. The items are iterated in the order that they appear in the vector
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="https://www.learnbyexample.org/wp-content/uploads/r/r-for-loop-syntax.png" width="50%" border="1"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

```r
colours &lt;- c("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")
for (color in colours){
  print(color)
}
```

```
[1] "red"
[1] "green"
[1] "blue"
[1] "yellow"
```

# Using for loops

```r
for (x in seq(from=2,to=14,by=2)) { #The seq() function creates a list from 2 to 14 going up every 2 numbers
  print(x^2) #Each number in this generated list will be raised to the power of 2
}
```

```
[1] 4
[1] 16
[1] 36
[1] 64
[1] 100
